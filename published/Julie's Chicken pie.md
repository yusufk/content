**1. Prepare the Chicken Filling:**

* In a saucepan, cook the chicken (use boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs, cut into smaller pieces) with lemon juice, salt, pepper, and mustard. 
* Cook until the chicken is thoroughly cooked through and tender.
* Once cooked, break the chicken into small shreds or mince it finely.

**2. Prepare the Potato Mash:**

* Boil one large potato until tender.
* Mash the cooked potato until smooth, ensuring there are no lumps.

**3. Combine Chicken and Potato:**

* In a bowl, mix the shredded cooked chicken with the mashed potato.
* Add approximately 1 tablespoon of chow-chow or piccalilli to the chicken and potato mixture. Stir to combine.

**4. Assemble the Pie:**

* **Prepare the Dough:** Use half of the dough (referred to as "dough from Indian delights- Mince in scones"). Roll it out to fit the bottom of a square baking tin.
* **Layer the Base:** Line the bottom of the squared baking tin with the rolled-out dough.
* **Sauce the Base:** Spread a layer of tomato sauce and a layer of mustard sauce over the dough base.
* **Add Chicken Filling:** Evenly distribute the chicken and potato filling over the sauced dough base.
* **Add Egg (Optional):** If desired, add sliced boiled eggs over the chicken filling.
* **Add Cheese:** Sprinkle a generous layer of grated cheese over the filling.
* **Top with Dough:** Roll out the remaining half of the dough and place it over the filling, creating a top crust.
* **Prepare the Top:** Use a fork to make small holes in the top crust to allow steam to escape.
* **Egg Wash and Seeds:** Smear the top of the pie with beaten egg. Sprinkle poppy seeds over the egg wash.

**5. Bake the Pie:**

* Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F).
* Bake the pie for 30-45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is heated through.

**6. Serve:**

* Allow the pie to cool slightly before slicing and serving.
