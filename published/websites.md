This website is sparse in terms of written content. The reason for this, is that I've been focussing more on using it as a learning platform than an outlet for my thoughts. When I switched to this latest version of my site, I decided to drop many years of content that I had accumulated, starting with my blogger site, then many years of Wordpress content.
