This website is sparse in terms of written content. The reason for this, is that I've been focussing more on using it as a learning platform than an outlet for my thoughts. When I switched to this latest version of my site, I decided to drop many years of content that I had accumulated, starting with my blogger site, then many years of Wordpress content. 

* 1997 - 2000: [www.angelfire.com/me/Yusufk](https://www.angelfire.com/me/Yusufk) - of which there is no trace on Archive.org
* 2004 - 2014: [Captains Blog Supplemental](https://web.archive.org/web/20140604065356/http://ysfk.blogspot.com/) - Archive.org has snapshots of the site from 2014, and it has posts from 2004, many of which were synched with my Google+ posts. 
* 2014 - 2022: [https://yusufk.co.za](https://web.archive.org/web/20140717143605/http://yusufk.co.za/) - Migrated to using Wordpress.
