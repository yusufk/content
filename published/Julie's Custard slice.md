Yields: Approximately 8-10 servings

Prep Time: 45 minutes

Cook Time: 20-25 minutes (for the layers) + 15-20 minutes (for the custard)

## Ingredients

### Pastry/Biscuit Layers

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder (or 2 cups self-raising flour)
- Pinch of salt
- ¼ cup granulated sugar
- 2 ounces (60g) unsalted butter, softened
- 1 large egg
- ½ cup milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Custard Filling

- 1 liter (4 cups) whole milk
- 4 tablespoons (level) custard powder
- ¼ cup granulated sugar (adjust to taste)
- ½ can (approximately 170g) sweetened condensed milk (adjust to taste)

## Instructions

**Preparing the Pastry Layers:**

1. **Preheat the Oven:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. **Combine Dry Ingredients:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder (if using), and salt.
3. **Cream Butter and Sugar:** In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This can be done with an electric mixer or by hand.
4. **Add Egg and Vanilla:** Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined.
5. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:** Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, starting and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined. Do not over-mix.
6. **Divide and Roll:** Divide the dough into 5-6 equal portions. On a lightly floured surface, roll each portion into a thin, round cake, approximately 8-9 inches in diameter.
7. **Bake the Layers:** Place the rolled-out dough rounds onto the prepared baking sheets. Prick the pastry with a fork to prevent excessive puffing. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until lightly golden. Watch carefully, as they can burn easily. Let the layers cool completely on a wire rack.

**Preparing the Custard Filling:**

1. **Heat the Milk:** In a medium saucepan, heat the milk over medium heat until it's just simmering.
2. **Combine Custard Powder and Sugar:** In a separate small bowl, mix the custard powder with the granulated sugar and a small amount of the warm milk to form a smooth paste. This prevents lumps.
3. **Add to Milk:** Gradually pour the custard mixture into the simmering milk, stirring constantly.
4. **Cook the Custard:** Continue to stir the custard over medium-low heat until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon.
5. **Add Condensed Milk:** Remove the custard from the heat and stir in the sweetened condensed milk. Adjust the sweetness to your preference. Let the custard cool slightly, stirring occasionally to prevent a skin from forming.
6. (Optional) Split the batch into 3 and apply different colouring to each.

**Assembling the Custard Slice:**

1. **Layering:** On a flat surface, place one baked pastry layer. Spread a generous layer of the custard over the pastry.
2. **Repeat:** Place another pastry layer on top of the custard and spread another layer of custard. Continue layering until all the pastry layers and custard are used, finishing with a layer of custard on top.
3. **Decorate:** Crush any extra pastry and sprinkle over the top.
4. **Chill:** Refrigerate the custard slice for at least 2-3 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the custard to set and the layers to soften slightly.
5. **Serving:** Before serving, you can dust the top with powdered sugar or drizzle with a thin icing for a decorative touch. Cut into squares or rectangles and serve.
