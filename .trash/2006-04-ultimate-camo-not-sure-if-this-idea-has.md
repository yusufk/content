The ultimate camo  

Not sure if this idea has been investigated by any1 else. Imagine is you could weave a suit out of optical fibers in such a way that the end point of one fiber is always 180 degrees to the other end and both are perpendicular to the surface of your body! the effect would be that light from any direction would be sent "through" you/the fibers and emerge at the opposite side, making you invisible!

Idea is copyright ofcourse, contact me for rights
