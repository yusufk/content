The best #WorkCulture experiences I've had had the following: 
1) Leadership that valued culture and were deliberate about establishing a good culture. 
2) Leaders that clearly articulated and reinforced a shared, audacious, impactful purpose that individuals were able to align to their personal sense of purpose.
3) Leaders that engaged at a human level.
4) Leaders that practiced 'situational leadership', setting job specs aside to understand and meet people where they are in their development and invest time in growing them further.
5) Leaders that modelled, coached and cared the culture they wanted to build.

Culture is driven by leadership.

The best operationalisation of good culture I've experienced so far was at Microsoft. The [model-coach-care framework ](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/management-excellence-at-microsoft-model-coach-care/the-meaning-of-manager-14492917) for leaders, the growth mindset approach for owning self-development, the embedding of collaboration into performance management as a fundamental and the respect afforded to downtime, are all practical, well understood and easy to measure operating models.
