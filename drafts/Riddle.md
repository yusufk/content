x,x,z

x+x+z = a + a + c = house
x*x*z != a*a*c 

2x + z = 2a +c = house 
x^2 *z = a^2 *c
z>x
c>a

A "Tough" Brainteaser

Eve is visiting her friends Alice and Bob. Both Alice and Bob have 3 children each.

Eve asks how old they are. Alice and Bob each give Eve the product of the ages of their three respective children. The products are different.

Eve says "I can't work out either set of children's ages".

Alice says "the sum of my children's ages is the same as the sum of Bob's children's ages, which is the same as our house number, which you know".

Eve thinks about it for a few minutes and then says, "I still can't solve it".

Finally Bob says "we both have twins, but they aren't our oldest children". "Ahh!" says Eve, now I know!

How old are Alice and Bob's 6 children?
