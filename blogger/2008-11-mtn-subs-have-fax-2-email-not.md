title: MTN subs have fax 2 email (not advertised)
-->

Just figured that as an MTN sub, I have fax-to-email and didn't even know.  
  
If you visit the MTN website [imail page](https://www.mtn.co.za/MyMTN/Communicate/Pages/i-mail.aspx) you can configure your email details.  
  
Then, if anyone sends a fax to 08314(+last nine digits of your MTN cell number) you will receive the fax as an email!  
  
Wish they'd advertise these things.
