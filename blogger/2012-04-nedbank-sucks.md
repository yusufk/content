In fact I have, said goodbye to Standard Bank after 20+ years and trying to say goodbye to Nedbank now too, and they are making the decision easy but the process difficult.

What happened?  I was just haggling with two banks over interest rates and funny thing is one of them told it is all about negotiation nowadays.  I got what I wanted in the end (from both banks) but I realised you have to play the one off against the other, and be prepared to act on your threats to leave them....

Their payment terminals certainly suck. I can't imagine how &quot;Randomly enter a few digits off the credit card number in some bizarre sequence&quot; is any better than &quot;Enter the last four digits&quot;.

Hey +Danie van der Merwe I agree with you I have just changed banks as part of buying a new home. And I spent most of my time negotiating. I reckon we start negotiating on bank charges !!!
