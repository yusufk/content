title: This is going to be the greatest thing since touch screen tech!
-->

  
My feature requests:  
1) Augmented reality -   
1.1) Must be able to look at my empty palm and have a virtual android device appear in my hand that I can interact with.  
1.2) Must be able to navigate using Google Navigate with the correct path highlighted green and with distance check like iOnroad.  
2) 3D - The glasses must enrich my handset display by serving as 3D glasses.

We’re sharing this information now because we want to start a conversation and learn from your valuable input. So we took a few design photos to show what this technology could look like and created a video to demonstrate what it might enable you to do.

Would you like fries with that, +Yusuf Kaka ? :-)

In fact, what I would like is an earpiece for audio? I didn't see that in any of the close-ups and it would suck if I needed to carry a bluetooth headpiece also.
