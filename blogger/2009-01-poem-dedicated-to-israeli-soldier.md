To the Israeli Soldier  
   
Listen and listen well  
O! One who could have been our brother  
For we are one people, whether you like it or not  
You are a Semite, A son of Israeel (Isaac)  
I am a Semite, A son of Ismaeel (Ishmael)  
Our father, the father of both you and I  
Is Ibrahim (Abraham)  
Or are you one who will even deny his own father?  
   
Listen and listen well  
O! One who could have been our brother  
We will die on our feet  
But we will not live on our knees.  
You know how to kill, But we know how to die  
Hitler gassed 6 million of you, But he could not kill your spirit  
Those who died only made stronger, those who remained alive  
Why then do you imagine; that if you become Hitlers  
The results of your 'gassing'  
Would be any different?  
   
Listen and listen well  
O! One who could have been our brother  
Just as others silently watched you going into the gas chambers  
Others silently watch us burying our children, the children that you continue to kill  
But we remind ourselves  
That the blow that does not break the back, only strengthens you.  
So O! You who used to be the People of Musa (Moses),  
But today you have become people of the Firawn (Pharaoh)  
Remember we are the real people of Moses, for we believe in his message; not you  
Remember that when the fight is between Moses and Pharaoh  
Moses always wins.  
   
We say to the silent watchers, the cowards,  
We say to those who sit securely in their homes  
We are the frontline who are holding back the enemy  
When we fall, it will be your turn.  
Remember O! Arabs  
The story of the White Bull (Al Thawr il Abyadh)  
Who said to the world when the tiger finally came for him  
Listen O! People, I do not die today,  
I died when the Black Bull died.  
   
Listen and listen well  
O! One who could have been our brother  
We did not come into this world to live here forever  
Neither did you  
One day we will all go from here  
Whether we like it or not  
What is important my brother, son of Israeel  
Sons of a Prophet, O! What have you become today?  
What have you allowed them to make you?  
Kill us, if that is what you want to do  
At least we die at the hands of our own brothers  
And not at the hands of strangers  
   
Listen and listen well  
O! One who could have been our brother  
We laugh as we see your Apache helicopters and F-16 jets fly overhead  
We laugh because we can smell your fear  
Why else do you need Apaches and F-16s to fight children with rocks?  
A battle of honor is between equals  
We challenge you, you who have sold your honor  
Come to us as equals; so that we can show you how to die with honor  
We laugh at you because we know, that not in a million years  
Will one of you ever have the guts to stand up to one of our children  
Without hiding behind an array of weapons that the American tax payer gives you  
We laugh at you, because that is what every warrior does   
When he faces an army of cowards.  
   
Listen and listen well  
O! One who could have been our brother  
It is not whether we live or die that is important  
It is how we live and how we die  
Ask yourself: How would you like to be remembered?  
Without respect, despised and accursed through the centuries,  
Or blessed, honored, your passing mourned.   
Allah is our witness: We lived with honor; begging for no favors  
And He is our witness: That today we die with honor; on our feet  
Fighting until the last breath leaves our body; even if all we have in our hands are stones  
He is the witness over us both  
As you kill us and as we die  
And to Him is our return  
   
Listen and listen well  
O! One who could have been our brother  
On that Day, my little baby who you killed last night  
Will ask Him for what crime she was murdered  
Prepare your answer, O! One who could have been our brother  
For you will answer to Him  
I swear by His Power: You will answer to Him.
