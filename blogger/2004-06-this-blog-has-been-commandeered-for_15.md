This blog has been commandeered for the purposes of mapping my technical journey, so lets get up to speed, I've been asked to develop a GUI for a Supply Chain Management Database, which resides on a FreeBSD box. I decided to use a web-based Java interface and will be looking at either JSP's or [Velocity.](http://jakarta.apache.org/) Considering the fact that I dont have a 4king clue about Java its going to be a challenge. Also will be using  [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/)  for the database stuff.
