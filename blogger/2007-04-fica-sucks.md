title: FICA Sucks
-->

After painfully submitting proof of residential address docs for FICA to Standard Bank thrice already, I just received notice that my account is not FICA compliant. AAAArrrrghhh!!!  
  
To make matters worse, I receive utility bills either via email or to my postal address because I don't trust the post-box at my house, like most South Africans.   
  
THEY (Standard Bank/FICA) don't accept pdf documents as proof of residence! How backward can you be??? Its just ridiculous in this day and age. They want the "original" documents. I would change banks if I didn't know already that the other banks suck as much.
