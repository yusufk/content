title: Online entry form for the Young Science Writer's Competition
-->

Yep, I considered entering the competition [Online entry form for the Young Science Writer's Competition](http://www.fest.org.za/sciencewriters/entry_online.shtml) ,couldnt decide on a topic so I though I'd explain EVERYTHING, that is Life the Universe and everything..  
  
Heres my 1st paragraph:  
  
Its the question that we've all asked ourselves at some point, what is Life? But how many have started answering the question by first asking, what is a point? A point is a position in time and an instance in time, two of the three defining axis of our Universe. Energy, the third axis is what everything is made of. You, your peanut butter sandwich and the 3rd left udder of a mountain goat on Table Mountain are energy in its slowest form, matter. On the other hand, Egoli on its way to your TV, the orange warmth of sunrise on its way from the sun and the flux that heats your microwave noodles are energy in its fastest form, electro-magnetic waves.
