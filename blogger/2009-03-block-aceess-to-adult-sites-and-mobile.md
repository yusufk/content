title: block aceess to adult sites and mobile chat on your kids phone (MTN)
-->

MTN had a parental control service that, like man of its other services is not advertised.  
  
In order to activate it, you need to dial \*101# from your kids phone. Then select option 4 to set yourself up as the guardian. Once you have setup a pin and the guardians cell number, you may then setup the blocking options, which allows you to block access to adult content, gambling or chat services.
