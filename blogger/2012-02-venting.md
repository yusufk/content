> I think the wireless network thing finally did get fixed, but the timezone never did - it still asks for the admin password.

> Whoever **moron** thought that it's "good security" to require the root password for everyday things like this is mentally diseased.

> So here's a plea: if you have anything to do with security in a distro, and think that my kids (replace "my kids" with "sales people on the road" if you think your main customers are businesses) need to have the root password to access some wireless network, or to be able to print out a paper, or to change the date-and-time settings, please just kill yourself now. The world will be a better place.
