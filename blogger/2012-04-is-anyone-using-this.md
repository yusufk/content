Yes, I am using it, but mostly to accept payment, not to make payment -- although I have don that as well.

Not in SA though +Piet Opperman? I thought our banking legislation doesn't allow pin-less payment or something like that. <br /><br />Are there enough retailers in the US to make this useful yet?

I am not a lawyer, so I can't comment on SA's banking legislation, other than to say that your assertion seems unlikely.<br />There are a multitude (50+) of establishments that accept this in my city, which is about the size of Bloemfontein. The nearest one is 12 Km from my home.

There are a number of local banking rules that restrict the use of these things. But there are also a number of local wallet type products, such as Pocit (<a href="http://www.pocit.co.za" rel="nofollow">www.pocit.co.za</a>). The thing is : will it be adopted by the local merchants. My guess it No. Sadly.
