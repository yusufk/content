title: How to initiate a firmware update on your DSTV decoder
-->

Not sure which models this applies to, but it works on my DSD 910 and has got me out of trouble at least twice so far.  

  
* Press standby and tv/music bottom together (In other words Reset)
  
* As soon as"dl" is displayed, press the standby button, then the program up, then the program down button and the standby button again.
  
* When the DL goes awayÂ  "ed" should come up and hopefully it will download the newest firmware.
