title: Solution to SA crime, buy a gun?
-->

I've been having this debate with family, friends and colleagues; Should we just buy guns and fight back against criminals?   
  
The majority of people respond by saying that some or other stats show that most gun owners end up hurting themselves or end up being shot with the same gun. Where can I find these statistics?  
  
As a Muslim, the Quraan makes it clear that we are meant to "enjoin good and forbid evil":  
The Noble Qur'an - Al-Tauba 9:71  
The Believers, men and women, are protectors one of another: they enjoin what is just, and forbid what is evil: they observe regular prayers, practise regular charity, and obey Allah and His Messenger. On them will Allah pour His mercy: for Allah is Exalted in power, Wise.   
  
Are we forbidding evil by standing back and allowing thieves to take what they want?
