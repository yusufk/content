title: Alloy XC HT
-->

The code XC HT printed on the side of my Mountain Bike really bugged me. At first I thought that perhaps Engineers are not the only humans that suffer from acronym diarrhoea and that Mountain Bikers were also infected. Then I realised that it was probably the Engineers that designed the frame that had put it there.  
  
I finally worked out that it stands for Cross Country Hard Tail. X = Cross is something uncommon in South Africa, but apparantly common-knowledge in the USA where I saw traffic signs saying Railway Xing. Finally realised then that Xing Mpeg player probably stood for Crossing Mpeg player and not Zing Mpeg player.
