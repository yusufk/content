[International Wireless Summit 2005, Aalborg, Denmark](http://www.iws2005.org/)  
  
The international wireless summit has just kicked off and I have the privilege of being amongst some of the greatest think-tanks in the wireless arena.  
  
The aim of the IWS is to offer a platform for establishing exchanges of information between universities, industry and science parks. The next summit will be in 2008 in Helsinki, Finland.  
  
International Wireless Symposium aims to exchange research information. 450 papers to be presented on “hot topics”.
