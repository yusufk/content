Yes it should be,it can then be up to each content provider to determine what is available. For example Lifehacker is in there and they are international, as should I be able to see my Google Reader subscriptions.<br /><br />BTW I did get my Currents to work (with &quot;hook and crook&quot; and it provides a wonderful view of my Reader subscriptions.
