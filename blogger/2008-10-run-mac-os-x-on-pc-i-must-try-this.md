title: Run Mac OS X on a PC - I must try this!
-->

[This article](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/20/macosx_on_a_pc/ "This article") has a step-by-step howto for setting up Mac OS X on a PC, will give it a tr when I have some time. Involves some BIOS fiddling so not for the feint hearted I guess.

MAC OS on a PC... Hmmm.. Thats like playing ps3 games on a xbox..<br /><br />Kewl concept..<br /><br />Quick Question - Are there any other OS's for PS3 apart from Linux..

**Joey said on 2008-10-22**

I think I heard someone mention XP or Vista, but I'd love to see how well Ubuntu runs on the PS3. I once tried getting Linux running on a PS1 and almost succeeded!
