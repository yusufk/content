I needed to turn off incoming calls while roaming and had to search around to find these. Thought Id post them here for future reference and to make your life easier. The code I used to turn of all incoming calls while roaming was:   
  
\*351\*0000\*11# (In country), or   
  
351\*0000\*10# (out of country)
