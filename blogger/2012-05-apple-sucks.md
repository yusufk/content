There I said it. It's taken months to try and sign up to the developer program and I'm still nowhere. They insist that legal documents have to be faxed through and the feedback is automated and slow. And the contact us page, in which one is expected to list their country of origin has every freaking country and region, EXCEPT for Africa?? Everyone on this continent is just meant to select other! What an insult.
