> The world's first "spherical flying machine" developed by Japan's ministry of defense. It can hover like a helicopter and take off and land vertically. If it hits an obstacle, it can maintain its trajectory through the use of gyroscopes. It can roll along the ground and walls to maneuver into position. The prototype is made of commercially available parts costing just $1,400. It's equipped with a camera.
