**IWS2005 Thursday**  
Keynote speech  
WLAN, Fixed Wireless and Cellular all have adopted space-time transmit diversity  
Only WLAN’s really use special MUX  
Celullar may never see special MUX  
  
Cognitive radio may present a challenge to spatial MUX in WiMAX  
MIMO in networks is different from MIMO in isolation  
  
Networks not prepared to cut down on power(loose channels) to include spatial diversity  
  
UWB panel discussion  
CSEM – built small, low complexity UWB solution  
Low data rate  
Tx 3.5 mW  
Rx 7.5 mW  
Radiated power 100uW  
Uses analogue spread spectrum and multi-path diversity  
Use of other MAC layer may reduce power further, WiseMAC, S-MAC  
  
CAPANINA Project  
Delivering Broadband from a high altitude, quasi stationary plane/airship  
120Mb/s symmetric links  
Delivery to rural areas, blocks of flats and moving train, using steerable antennae  
Optical links for backhaul 48/47GHz 31/28GHz  
University of York UK, NICT Japan  
60Km diameter user area coverage, single or multiple cell  
Possible backhaul via satellite  
802.16, 802.20, 802.11 , ETSI Hiperaccess, hiperMAN, DVB  
802.16sc is best overall choice  
WiMAX, possible depending on regulators  
17 – 22 Km above the ground  
Dish sizes less than 30 cm  
Issues: HAP station keeping and moving train  
Antennae: mechatronic and smart  
Use 8X8antenna array to block out interfering signals  
  
Test system in Sweden delivered 4Mb/s throughput 802.11b and 1.25Gb/s freespace optic link  
Dr. David Grace [dg@ohm.york.ac.uk](http://mailto:dg@ohm.york.ac.uk/)  
[www.capanina.org](http://www.capanina.org/)  
200-300 000 euros for test tethered platform  
  
This has given me an idea!!! Why not put an AP on an advertisement gas balloon as a hop between Jhb and PTA?  
   
Improved Triangulation Method using a Movement model  
Localisation done in Bluetooth  
Inquiry procedure provides RSSI  
Movement model variables: Speed, direction based on previous measurements  
Without prior knowledge: Speed truncated normal distribution with a mean of 1m/s and std dev of 0.5m/s  
Direction uniform between -180 and 180  
With prior knowledge, previous measurements used to determine speed

Planning of Large-scale WLAN infrastructures, Methodius University, Macedonia  
Planning either done using educated guesses or with auto planning  
Dominant path approach used for propagation modelling  
Propogation Modelling, Coverage optimisation and channel alloc optimisation  
Wireless Indoor Design Tool, version 1 (WIDT v1) to be released soon  
Possible use in indoor mesh?
