title: Regarding wearing trowsers above the ankles..
-->

I think that the hadith below clearly shows that it's all about the persons intention, if you're wearing your trouser/robe below your ankle out of pride then it's wrong, otherwise it's fine.  
  
Narrated Abdullah bin Umar: That Allah's Apostle said, "Allah will not look on the Day of Judgment at him who drags his robe (behind him) out of pride." Abu Bakr said "One side of my robe slacks down unless I get very cautious about it." Allah's Apostle said, "But you do not do that with a pride." [Shaih Bukhari (5:57:17)](http://www.islamicnet.com/hadith.html)
