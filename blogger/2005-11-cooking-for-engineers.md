title: Cooking For Engineers
-->

Although I prefer eating to cooking, I have dabbled. I came accross a cooking site that makes the though a lot more comfortable: [Cooking For Engineers](http://www.cookingforengineers.com/). Theres also an interesting article on [Saturated Fats, Cholesterol, and Heart Disease](http://www.cookingforengineers.com/article.php?id=40). My conclusions, stop the Potato Chips (Hydrogenated Oils), replace marg with good ol' butter and everything in moderation (I love relativity).
