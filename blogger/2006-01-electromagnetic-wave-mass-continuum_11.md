The Electromagnetic Wave-Mass continuum  

What if EVERYTHING is made up of Electromagnetic waves? It maybe that mass as we know it is just made up of very very high frequency electromagnetic waves. The theory is consistent with the particle nature of light in that EM waves start to show matter-like properties as the frequency increases. Has anyone managed to measure/produce EM waves with frequencies beyond that of Gamma rays? (10^24Hz). It just sounds so simple that it probably is true!
