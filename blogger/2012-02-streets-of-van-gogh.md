> This is Arles, which is only a short drive from Montpellier and less than an hour from the CÃ´te d'Azur. The streets are quaint and quiet. There are a few tourist areas, but after a few steps in a random direction, you're back in the old streets. I needed to stay for longer for more exploration (!), but I did my best to make use of the short time I was there.
