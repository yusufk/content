> Research team posits theory that memory could be encoded in the 3 dimensional structure of the neuron cell.  
>   
> *"Memory is attributed to strengthened synaptic connections among particular brain neurons, yet synaptic membrane components are transient, whereas memories can endure. This suggests synaptic information is encoded and ‘hard-wired’ elsewhere, e.g. at molecular levels within the post-synaptic neuron."*  
>   
> *"The team looked into structures at the cytoskeletal level of brain structure. They found components that fit together and were capable of creating the information processing and storage capacity that the brain needs to form and retain memory."*  
>   
> *Microtubules fill the interiors of our brain's neurons, especially in axons and dendrites where most of the activity takes place. We undertook to find out if this similarity is accidental or not. This led to the generation of a very accurate computational model of the interaction between CaMKII and microtubules. **It looks to us that a mechanism for memory encoding has now been found.***

> *The cytoskeleton (also CSK) is a cellular "scaffolding" or "skeleton" contained within a cell's cytoplasm and is made out of protein. The cytoskeleton is present in all cells; it was once thought to be unique to eukaryotes, but recent research has identified the prokaryotic cytoskeleton.*
