Why would anyone want to use a pencil to write on their screen?  Nice tech demo but I think that the reality is that gesture control for daily computing is going to be rather niche.  Can you imagine how tired your arms will get?

That could have been said about the mouse? In the end, it will supplement what we already use. I would rather gesture a forward, backward or enlarge on my browser. And at $69, it's worth it. It's probably best to get one and see I think.

In fact, there is a quote regarding the computer mouse: <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1958-the-nature-of-the-personal-computer-is-simply" rel="nofollow">http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1958-the-nature-of-the-personal-computer-is-simply</a><br />&quot;The nature of the personal computer is simply not fully understood by companies like Apple (or anyone else for that matter). Apple makes the arrogant assumption of thinking that it knows what you want and need. It, unfortunately, leaves the “why” out of the equation — as in “why would I want this?” The Macintosh uses an experimental pointing device called a “mouse.” There is no evidence that people want to use these things. I don’t want one of these new fangled devices.&quot;<br />—<br />San Francisco Examiner, John C. Dvorak, 19 Feb. 1984
