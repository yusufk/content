Freedom of Expression, a licence to kill  

The media is not threatened by Muslims anger over the publication of those cartoons depicting the cartoonists impression of our Prophet (SAW). All the anger and reaction is just feeding the media monster, giving it more to report on and free advertising for those daring to re-print the cartoons, for example the cheap-shot [Mail and Guardian article](http://www.mg.co.za/articlepage.aspx?area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__national&articleid=263670), which may even get a few more hits because of this reaction.

To quote a moulana at Mayfair Jummah masjid, "There's a lesson in everything..." and one of the lessons from this event is that we as Muslims are partly responsible for giving the wrong impression of our Prophet (SAW). We boast that we try to imitate our Prophet's ways and actions, but do we really do it wholeheartedly or do we just choose aspects which suit us? On the other hand, I don't think that the cartoonist had any intention of portraying a true reflection. He simply expressed the view created by Bush and co., spread by the media and shared by much of the non-Muslim world.

In the end Freedom of Expression and Democracy will prevail as licences to kill, Human dignity and respect for humanity on the other hand will be the victim.
