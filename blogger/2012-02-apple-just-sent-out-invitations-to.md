> Apple just sent out invitations to an event next Wednesday to be held at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. Besides the time and location information, the invite only says “We have something you really need to see. And touch.” The words are superimposed on what is almost certainly an iPad.  
>   
> It’s all but a done deal now: Apple will unveil the iPad 3 on March 7. The event is due to begin at 10 a.m. Pacific Time (1 p.m. ET)
