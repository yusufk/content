title: This is what your greed for oil means to Iraqi's
-->

[This](http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2293485.ece#2007-02-22T00:00:14-00:00) is a report of a sickening incident in Iraq. Makes you wonder what other atrocities go by un-reported. And all this so that Bush and co. can wallow in more oil. Shame on those of you that support this war with your taxes or even your silence. All of this in the name of stupid patriotism.   
  
May that family be blessed with Jannah and may those guilty pay for their sins in this life and the next.  
  
 Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: The Prophet sent Mu'adh to Yemen and said, "Be afraid, from the curse of the oppressed as there is no screen between his invocation and Allah." [Shaih](http://www.islamicnet.com/hadith.html)
