title: Alpine Heath Groupon deal - Be Careful!
-->

  
I've bought a few deals on Groupon in the last year, without any problems, magazine subscriptions, restaurant deals, etc. The last one however turned out to be a disaster because of Fineprint which means more than it says. When purchasing an Alpine Heath deal, be aware that 'subject to availability' means subject to availability of 'groupon allocated chales'. I bought the deal last year after phoning and confirming that there were available chalets during the period I was looking for. When I called back to confirm the booking and mentioned the Groupon code, the Chalet suddenly became unavailable. Instead of explaining the situation, the staff at Alpine Heath kept trying to hide the fact that they only made a few chalets available to Groupon and refused to let me talk to anyone with authority. Bad customer experience combined with Fineprint make for a bad experience. Be careful!
