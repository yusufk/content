title: Calling all time travellers.
-->

It's time to end all debate on time travel. Here and now. With this blog post, I aim to settle the matter of time travel once and for all.  
  
   
> Dear Time Traveller.  
>   
> I'm guessing that prior to having invented time travel, you 1st embarked on a literature survey. I'm also hoping that Google still exists, whenever you are and that this blog post is still archived somewhere. I'm also hoping that the millions of readers that read my blog have raised the Page Rank of this post significantly so that you would have found it during your literature survey.  
>   
> If you are about to embark on some time travel adventure, I want you to please set your destination clock to a time that allows you the opportunity to convince me that it is possible. You will need to travel down to now (check post date and time), and to Johannesburg, South Africa, and come say hello. If you do, I will update this post, verifying that Time Travel is indeed possible.  
>   
> If however you don't make it, Time Travel shall, in 24 hours time, be deemed impossible. Humanity will give up hope in the possibility and either you or your project will no longer exist as a result.  
>   
> Your clock starts now.
