title: Kam&#39;a, Dessert Truffles, cure for eyes, where can I get this stuff?
-->

After reading this hadith, I've been wondering if this stuff is available in South Africa? :  
  
[Sahih Bukhari, Book 60](http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/sbtintro.html)  
  
*Volume 6, Book 60, Number 5:*   
> Narrated Said bin Zaid:  
>   
> Allah's Apostle said, "The Kam'a (i.e. a kind of edible fungus) is like the Manna (in that it is obtained without effort) and its water is a (medicine) cure for eye trouble."
