> Thank you, friends, yes, losses continue unabated. At current trends, predictions for end 2012 is that we will lose, through non-natural deaths, more than 1 000 Rhino. According to ethical SA conservationists, this represents probably in the region of 12% of the world's Rhino population. This is why Rhino Ultimatum is so critical and time is not on our or Rhino's side. Pls help to support this Rhino Ultimatum wherever you can. SA Govt MUST be taken to task for this atrocity against the natural world. Thank you for your care.
