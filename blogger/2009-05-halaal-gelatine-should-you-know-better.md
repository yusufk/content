title: Halaal Gelatine - Should you know better?
-->

In my opinion, the whole halaal gelatine issue is a sad reflection of how divided we are as Muslims. At the moment, there are 3 major Halaal "authorities" in South Africa, SANHA, MJC and NIHT.  
  
SANHA approves only gelatine derived from Halaal animals as Halaal, while the other two certify gelatine derived from haraam animals as halaal. The reason given by MJC is that the gelatine undergoes significant change from its original state (bones) to make it irreversible.  
  
My opinion is that this reason is dodgy and I seem to be in the minority on this one.  
  
I have one question that no one at MJC / NIHT seem to have been asked. Why don't they then certify gelatine derived from Pigs as halaal? Surely it undergoes the same process? Is there a difference between consuming a haraam cow and a pig? The hadith used to justify "significantly metamorphosed animals" mentions a donkey that dissolved into a salt-pan. Would NIHT/MJC certify gelatine derived from donkies halaal? (ok, that was more than one question)  
  
Sounds dodgey to me.

Do you have any facts / links to back up what you're saying (gelatine derived from haraam animals)? I really don't think any halaal certifying body will mislead the ummah in that manner, it is a huge sin. How can anyone live with that?<br /><br />What I do know is that Sanha is in it for the money.

Yes, see here: http://www.halaal.org.za/getArticle.php?id=11 (NIHT website). If you extract the important bits from the waffle, they're explaining why they think Gelatine from haraam animals is halaal. Most of SA's gelatine, including that in Beacon products, is from Davis gelatine. They use animals not slaughtered the halaal way. (http://www.vocfm.co.za/public/articles.php?Articleid=27988)<br /><br />The MJC also had a similar page, with the same explanation but the halaal pages on their site seem broken now?<br /><br />My thoughts exactly regarding the misleading, which is why I'm surprised this hasn't been resolved after so many years.<br /><br />As for SANHA being in it for the money, I fear that money/consumerism might be the reason why the others have certified gelatine derived from haraam animals as halaal.<br /><br />I just thought that its important that we as muslims understand what it is we are eating regardless of whose stamp is on the product.<br /><br />Allah knows best.

Do ICSA still exist..<br /><br />This is a very touchy issue apparently.. Esp wit the whole metamorphosis issue.. <br />I always maintain.. When in doubt.. Abstain !!!

**Yusuf said on 2009-05-25**

thanks bro!<br /><br />as for the swine comment, I'm of the opinion that when something is deemed haraam, then there are no grey areas, just a black line that one crosses. I.e. Eating a haraam chicken is as bad as eating pork. Ofcourse I may be wrong and if so, let me know with some supporting hadith perhaps?<br /><br />Swine aside, how about donkey gelatine?

**Yusuf said on 2009-05-26**

You bring up another interesting point for me. There seems to be a distinction between halaal to consume and halaal to use. The Hadith NIHT uses regarding tanned leather illustrates my point exactly. Tanning leather of a haraam animal makes it halaal to use. I doubt anyone will enjoy eating a piece of leather? And so this Hadith cannot be applied to something which is edible?<br /><br />Also, its not only hooves and hair, in fact its mostly bones that they use to make gelatine.<br /><br />p.s. I also eat food certified by NIHT/MJC, except if it contains gelatine.

Good idea. If they can't come to an agreement, at least the people witnessing will have both sides of the argument 1st hand and not via 3rd parties.

Bismillahirrahmanirrahim,<br /><br />According to latest research,  bovine and porcine gelatin ate not molecularly identical. Porcine gelatin does not still lose its pork characther after going through all those processes. <br /><br />Related article:<br />http://sourcedb.cas.cn/sourcedb_ipe_cas/zw/lwlb/200909/P020090909609485798189.pdf

Slmz,<br /><br />Once again, I wish I'd done biology at school ;)<br /><br />Anyway, my understanding from reading the abstract and sifting through the paper, is that it is possible to identify the source (Porcine or Bovine) of the Gelatin based on marker peptides.<br /><br />I'm not sure how this relates to my argument though? Yes, of-course they will be different, the originate from different animals. And its great that we can differentiate between them, but unfortunately, we can't differentiate through any analysis, which of these animals were slaughtered in a halaal manner. For this we need to establish a chain of trust, Muslim to Muslim, back to the slaughterer.<br /><br />Also, if these &quot;marker peptides&quot; remain, then is this &quot;a complete metamorphic change&quot;? Not sure I want to enter into that debate either, because complex things like that can usually be argued either way.<br /><br />Thanks for the paper though, very interesting.<br /><br />Yusuf

In order to express myself better:<br /><br /><br />Porcine derived gelatine is a topic of discussion among the Muslim<br /><br />community. Should it be considered as halal or haram?<br /><br />Until now, there has not been an agreement on a single view. Basically<br /><br />there are 3 main different opinions:<br /><br /><br />1) Gelatin is only halal if the source animal is halal and also slaughtered<br /><br />in the Islamic way.<br /><br />2) Gelatin is only halal if the source animal is halal and slaughter method<br /><br />is not a factor.<br /><br />3) Gelatin is always halal no matter the source animal is halal or not.<br /><br /><br />First view is of course the most conservative one and can be obviously<br /><br />defended by stating some Islamic rules. I don't find the second view<br /><br />meaningful because it can be falsified even by the contradiction within<br /><br />itself. Third view was introduced by the support of some scientific<br /><br />arguments in relation to various hadiths.<br /><br /><br />According to Islam, when something changes its composition until it can<br /><br />not be related to its source, it is considered as a completely different<br /><br />material. This is called istihala. A good example would be animal carcass.<br /><br />Carcass is considered unclean, but if it is burned and becomes ashes, or<br /><br />decompose and becomes earth, then it is considered clean. This can<br /><br />happen even with feces. It is very logical if we take in to consideration<br /><br />that every material on earth is always going through recycling and used<br /><br />again by a completely different being. [1]<br /><br /><br />So, can we actually say that porcine derived gelatin is halal since it goes<br /><br />through chemical changes until it loses its swine characteristics<br /><br />completely? Well I mentioned this question because it is the basis behind<br /><br />the 3rd view. But in fact the question itself is scientifically incorrect.<br /><br />I made a research on this subject and found out that the fact is not like<br /><br />the question states it. If the assumption, &quot;the porcine gelatin goes<br /><br />through enough chemical changes until it loses its swine character<br /><br />completely&quot; was true , we should not be able to differentiate porcine<br /><br />derived gelatin molecule from others. The truth is we can. [2]<br /><br /><br />Gelatin is not molecularly same material whether it is derived from porcine<br /><br />or bovine. Recent studies have proven that the porcine derived gelatin can<br /><br />still be identified by its source. Contrary to popular belief, it can now be<br /><br />detected even in a mixture of bovine and porcine derived gelatin. [3]<br /><br /><br />In summary, we can say that the argument behind the view which defends<br /><br />porcine gelatin may be halal is not valid. Therefor, it is still a necessity for<br /><br />the halal seekers not to consume porcine derived gelatin.<br /><br />(Allah knows better.)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Emre Metin<br /><br /><br />References:<br /><br />1.

JazaakAllah for the post and the explanation below.<br /><br />I agree with your classification of the different views. I think the key is in your statement: &quot;According to Islam, when something changes its composition until it can not be related to its source, it is considered as a completely different material.&quot;<br />The paper you referenced, informs me that both Porcine and Bovine Gelatin contain peptide markers that relate them to their source. Hence, there is no istihala in the gelatin manufacturing process?

JazaakAllah bro Muhammed for the comprehensive comment. Do you work for Zamha? If so, may I embed the .pdf http://www.zamha.com/announce/halaal%20articles/Gelatin.pdf somewhere on my blog?
