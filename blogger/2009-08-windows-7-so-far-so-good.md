title: Windows 7, so far so good!
-->

I know that this is not a feature of Windows 7, but heck, its part of my experience. This is my 1st blog post, not done from the WP Admin console (I know, I know). I’m using Windows Live Writer, which I discovered while exploring Windows 7. And that’s that. Nothing more to say, except that I love the following about Windows 7 so far:

* Like the way the taskbar allows one to pin applications
* Like the way the themes work and backgrounds change
* Like the libraries feature, allowing me to collate multiple folders for My Documents, My Music etc, from different places.
* Like the bootup and shutdown times

Don’t like the fact that the licence is going to expire at some point!
