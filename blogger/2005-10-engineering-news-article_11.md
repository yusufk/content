Its amazing how a simple idea like the cantenna has grabbed the attention of the media. So far I've been interviewed on SABC Africa and by Engineering News ([Tin-can bridge to digital society](http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article.php?a_id=74454)). One would have thought that the technical, innovative stuff we're doing with ad-hoc networking in the larger project would have more interest. I suppose that its easier to grasp the imagination with simplicity.
