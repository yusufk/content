title: 'The new home of my Ubuntu Linux related blogs: yusufk''s Journal'
-->

I've decided to move my Ubuntu related blogs to [Ubuntu Linux Forums - vB Journal: yusufk's Journal](http://ubuntuforums.org/journal.php?do=showjournal&j=39), beacuse its closer to where I usually find answers anyway. This blog maybe quieter though, not that anyone gives a nut, coz I'm the only one that reads this, hehe.
