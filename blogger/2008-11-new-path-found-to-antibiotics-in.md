title: New Path Found To Antibiotics In Dirt(Sand)
-->

[This article](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/11/081111211446.htm) in Science Daily mentions the presence of Anti-biotics in soil, which reminded me of a Hadith I read which stated that the Sahaaba used to injest a pinch of soil (taking Allah's name ofcourse) when they were ill. Not that there needed to be antibiotics properties there in the 1st place for Allah to cure them, but the very fact that there is could have been just because of their duah / faith in Allah.
