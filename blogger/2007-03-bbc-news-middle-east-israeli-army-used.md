| **An Israeli human rights group has accused Israel's army of using two young Palestinians as human shields during a recent raid in the West Bank.**  The B'Tselem group said it had testimony from a 15-year-old boy, his 24-year-old cousin and also an 11-year-old boy.  They said soldiers had forced them at gunpoint to enter houses ahead of the troops during the raid in Nablus. |
