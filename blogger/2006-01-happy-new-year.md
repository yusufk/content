title: Happy new year!
-->

I've been thinking...which is undoubtedly a welcomed occurance. I find myself deep inside a trough and its time to plan my way out again. I began by sticking to a commitment I made to cycle regularly, after investing in a cool new bike(See: <http://www.marin.co.uk/marin-2005/bikedetail.php?ModNo=2542> ). Thats the physical excercise taken care of. For the mind, I plan to read more, starting with the literature review I need to to toward my thesis proposal. And finally, what should have been sorted out first, I need to get back into performing my Salaah on time. Everything will come right if i get that right, I know from experience! InshaAllah.
