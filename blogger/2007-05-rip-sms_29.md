-->

The Internet has a new arsenal against the telecoms world; Web 2.0.  
  
With a combination of [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/) and either:  
  
[Widsets](http://www.blogger.com/www.widsets.com) with the twitter widget  
  
or  
  
a Gtalk account with a mobile IM client like [mxit](http://www.mxit.co.za/)   
  
one can send free sms's from a mobile!  
  
All you need to do is use the IM client/ widsets widget to send a direct twitter to a friend and he will receive the message as an SMS, thanks to twitter!
