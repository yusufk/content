title: '''60 die'' as Afghan boat sinks - CNN.com'
-->

It's quite interesting to note how much of this article centers around the tragic drowning of 60 people and how much of it reminds the reader that the Taliban are bad people. I would feel offended if I were american, that CNN has the impression that my IQ cannot be more than 30.  
  
Read between the lines people, somebody did something terrible here and once again, the Afghans have had to pay the price.
