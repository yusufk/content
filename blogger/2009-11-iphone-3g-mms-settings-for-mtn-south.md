title: iPhone 3G MMS settings for MTN South Africa
-->

Required: OS 3.0 and above (verified on OS 3.12)  
  
Installing MTN MMS Settings  

  
* Go to “settings”
  
* Go to “general"
  
* Go to “network”
  
* Go to “cellular data network”
  

  
Under the MMS section enter the following information:  

  
* APN : internet
  
* Username: mtnmms
  
* Password: mtnmms
  
* MMSC: http://mms.mtn.co.za/mms/wapenc
  
* MMS Proxy: 196.011.240.241:8080
  

  
Restart the phone and you’re good to go!  
  
In case your Internet settings are blank, you can try the following:  

  
* APN: myMTN
  
* Usnername: mtnwap
  
* Password: mtnwap
  

  
p.s. Don’t expect there to be an MMS icon or app, its simply integrated into messaging. The only difference is that you can now attach Pictures.

Yep, those settings should be installed from Apple. If you're having problems, dial *123*12# to reset your config on the network side.

I have done all of the above and my does NOT work. No help from MTN or AutoPage. Just get &quot;Can't connect to cellular network&quot;
