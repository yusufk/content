title: Why are there no 3G modems with video call support???
-->

It seems like an obvious feature of a 3G modem, yet I can't find any support for video calls on 3G modems. It should be as easy as AT DV to initiate a video call but it isn't. No wonder 3G is not being utilized, some of the obvious use cases seem to have been ignored.  
  
Or maybe I'm just not Googling properly....
