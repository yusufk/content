title: A script for adding multiple twitter follows....
-->

[@magitam](http://twitter.com/magitam) had an interesting [problem](http://twitter.com/magitam/status/1036792297) and I had an itch to try out the [python-twitter](http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/) API.  
  
follow.py is the result.  
  
Usage: ./follow.py <twitter username> <twitter password> <filename.csv>")  
  
Copy the code above and save it using notepad as follow.py  
  
You will need a [python interpreter](http://www.python.org/download/) and the [python-twitter API](http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter) to run it. Tested on Linux but should run anywhere.  
  
The input file can be either:  
> friend1  
>   
> friend2  
>   
> friend3

  
or  
> friend1,friend2,friend3

  
or  
> friend1,friend2  
>   
> friend3

Thanks @yusufk - I really appreciate it :)<br />Just to clarify - where do I need to have the python-twitter API?  Does it have to be installed locally on my computer?  I'm guessing it might be just a library or dependency, right?<br />Will try it out on Asus EEE PC later today, and tweet you if I come across any problems!<br />Thanks so much dude!  Between you and @lord_matty I hope that I'll be able to get this challenge dealt with!

Yes it is a library and if you're running Ubuntu, its as easy as apt-get install python-twitter<br /><br />There are instructions on the python-twitter site for installing it on other platforms.<br /><br />Good luck!
