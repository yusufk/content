JOHANNESBURG, 23 May 2008 - Community leaders have announced that Durbanites will not be forcefully expatriated from Gauteng soil, as is the case with the recent violent attacks on foreign nationals. The announcement follows days of negotiations between the Lenz Observer Group (LOG) and the Chatsworth-based Check My New Car Foundation.

Tensions between Gauteng locals and Durbanites unexpectedly rose last week in the wake of the province's violent Xenophobic attacks. Independent analyst Sarah Friedman says while the root causes were similar, there are some fundamental differences. Friedman says it's unlikely that locals are distressed about their women being drawn

to the Durbanites, as is the case with the national Xenophobic tension. She refused to elaborate further.

Check My New Car Foundation's Kevin Naidoo insists it's a matter of professional envy. " Hey, check hereâ€¦ they jus jealous because why ? because we more sharp upstairs.. just look at who got all the top jobs " said Naidoo. Naidoo stopped short of dismissing claims

that Durbanites have an inability to subtly show-off.

Spokesperson for the Lenz Observer Group Yugan Veeran told a press briefing on Thursday that reports suggesting that locals were hacking into computers to confirm the birth place of Durbanites were "ludicrous". Veeran said such espionage activities were hardly necessary. He listed easier forms of establishing identity, which include, a dramatic change in accent upon arrival in Gauteng; conspicuous overdressing in back-firing attempts to seek attention; and an overly emphasised nightlife to demonstrate social progress.

Both sides however maintain that they have reached common ground following the weekend negotiations.
