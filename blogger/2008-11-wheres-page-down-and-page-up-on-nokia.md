title: wheres the page-down and page-up on the Nokia e90????
-->

One of the things I hate about my Nokia e90 is the fact that it supports emails but it doesn't have the ability to page down or up through a list of emails :( or through a long email.

The one shortcoming i have on the iPhone is it has NO MMS support..So the e90 short coming is mild i think

Agreed, but thats the point, I want to point out the obvious small shortcomings that make the product just short of perfect. On the iPhone MMS issue, does one really need MMS when you have email? I can tell you that the MMS standard seems to be stuck where it is entacipating the day when email is available on all devices.
