title: Google Launches Google TV - Sponsored series and Movies
-->

After watching 5 minutes of a pathetically produced news bulletin on SABC 3 the other day, I allowed my mind to drift away into a possible future where we could get quality free broadcasting. The headline that came to mind is the title of this blog post. No, they haven't launched Google TV, yet, but it would be awesome if they did. I think it would be relatively easily done using what they already have, Youtube, Google Video etc. All that would be required is licensing agreements with producers and broadcasters and some creative thinking on how to insert ads.  
  
Its wishful thinking, but its a win-win waiting to happen and Google hasn't let many of those slip by in the past!
