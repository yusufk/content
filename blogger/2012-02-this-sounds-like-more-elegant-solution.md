This sounds like a more elegant solution than dark energy to me..

> *Massimo Villata of the National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) in Pino Torinese, Italy, **describes dark energy as “embarrassing,”** saying that the **concept is an ad hoc element to standard cosmology and is devoid of any physical meaning.** Villata is one of many scientists who are looking for new explanations of the Universe’s accelerating expansion that involve some form of repulsive gravity. In this case, the repulsive gravity could stem from antimatter hiding in voids.*

This theory holds that it is the altered shape of space, deformed by massive objects, that causes 'gravity', which is actually a property of deformed space rather than being a true force. Although the equations cannot produce a "negative geometry" normally, it is possible to do so using a "negative mass". The same equations do not, of themselves, rule out the existence of negative mass.*

In particular, Sir Hermann Bondi proposed in 1957 that negative gravitational mass, combined with negative inertial mass, would comply with the strong equivalence principle of general relativity theory and the Newtonian laws of conservation of linear momentum and energy.*

 [Repulsive gravity as an alternative to dark energy (Part 1)](http://www.physorg.com/news/2012-01-repulsive-gravity-alternative-dark-energy.html)  
 (PhysOrg.com) -- When scientists discovered in 1998 that the Universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, the possibility that dark energy could explain the observation was intriguing. But because t...
