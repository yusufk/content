**Dude from Siemens:**  
Performance increase by 100X every 5 yrs  
Experimentation currently at 1Gbs  
  
Higher frequencies aimed at for 4g have less coverage.  
  
**Dude from board of every 4 letter acronym known to man:**  
(KDDI R&D) Dr. Yasuo Hirate  
  
Japan uses W-CDMA (90 mil users)  
  
Aimed at 100Mbs by 2010  
  
Fixes mobile convergence  
Seamless network of mobile and wireless lan  
Integration, Seamless, Barrier Free  
Convergence of Fixed, Wireless, Cellular and Digital Broadcast  
  
**Dude from Qualcomm, formerly AT&T Bell Labs:**  
Anil Kripalani  
Ubiquitous Search and Discovery  
  
Coming soon: Phones with hard-disks and 7.1 Mega pixel camera  
  
**Dude from Nokia:**  
Dr. Jan Bosch  
“Lifepod” – Record everything  
  
**Dude from Saumsung:**  
Dr. Young Kyun Kim  
Telecoms and Broadcasting convergence  
4g : IP Ubiquitous Network  
Mobile terminal as gateway to WiLan, BT, RFID, IrDA and IP Network  
IPv6 based network  
2 paths to 4G, 1 is the cellular path 1G, 2G, 3G ( , 2nd path is the “nomadic” path, wlan, BT, Zigbee, RFID ( 4G  
WiBro (Mobile WiMax), ubiquitous networks in Korea  
Apec summit in Nusan Korea will demo large volume VoD, MoD  
  
**Dude from Intel:**  
Dan Dahle  
3g for WAN  
WiMax for MAN  
WiFi for LAN  
UWB and BT fot PAN  
NFC, RFID  
Wireless Requirement  
Throughput, Latency, tolerance for loss, mobility, interference, capacity, bandwidth, throughput, power consumption, complexity  
  
**Dudette from Alcatel:**  
Simplicity, continuum of service  
Heterogeneous Access Management required for multiple radio systems.  
Multi-radio terminal, transparent to user and power-wise  
IMS architecture enabler of new applications  
  
  
**Summary**  
4G is a network of networks, it is a solution looking for a problem.  
Terminal has to accommodate converged radio networks.  
“The user wants to google cnn anytime, anywhere at the right cost having all security considered…”
