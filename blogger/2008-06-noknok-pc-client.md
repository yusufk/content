The [noknok](http://www.noknok.co.za/how-do-i-get-it.html) service, still in it's infancy is by no means the best out there, especially in South Africa. However, the [PC client](http://www.noknok.co.za/downloads/MTN_IMPS_PC.exe) is one of the best pc based messengers I've used, if you get it to install that is ;)  
  
Tip: Do not use the link provided by the install application if you don't have .Net framework installed. The link provides you .Net version 1.1 while the application requires version 2.0, daft oversight. Use [this link](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856EACB-4362-4B0D-8EDD-AAB15C5E04F5&displaylang=en) instead or install version 3.  
  
The reason I think it's cool is that it allows you to send SMS and MMS messages straight from your desktop.  
  
The SMS's are free, but MMS's are charged.  
  
Best feature though in my opinion, is the fart nudge, which I never get tired off, much to the dismay of many of my ref-faced colleagues.
