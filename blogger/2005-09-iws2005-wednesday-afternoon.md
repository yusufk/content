Power Efficient  
Wireless is unrelieable, high BER  
Leads to high power consumption  
Use Co-operative Diversity (spatial diversity)  
Does this lower transmission power of individual nodes?  
REalisation:  
hardware - Mulitple antenna on every node, minimum distance between antennas should be l/2 = 6.12 cm  
software - Space -time codes, two dimensional array  
Nodes with single antennas cop-operate to create a virual MIMO, which gives the same effect [Laneman et al]
