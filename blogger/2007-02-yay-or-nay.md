title: Yay or Nay?
-->

After a recent accident and the more importantly the subsequent dealings with my insurance company and trying to find a decent panel beater, I decided that what I and probably many other South Africans need is a website where one can find information about service providers in South Africa. I was also curious about low budget hosting sites and domain name registration etc. so I put up [yayornay](http://www.yayornay.co.za) . Ok, so the name is quite lame, but it's been quite a learning experience using the Xoop cms.
