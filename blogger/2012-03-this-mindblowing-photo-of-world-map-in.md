> You may think that this image recently posted on Reddit is a 3D rendering or some Photoshop trickery, but it's a real photo. A refraction of a world map through a water drop.

> It was taken by **Markus Reugels**, who is an expert on capturing liquids in an awesome way, using a special rig created by himself. He spends weeks in creating images like these, taking about five hundred pictures before obtaining a couple of perfect images. [Flickr, Edemiya and Daily Mail via Reddit]
