Duplicate Address Detection in OLSR networks, Thomas Clausen, Inria  
  
MANETS: Mobile Adhoc Networks, do not comply with traditional internet hypothesis  
Networks split and re-combine and may cause address conflicts.  
DHCP is statefull , server based and sensitive to partitioning  
IPV6 also has similar problems  
Pro-active protocol  
Inspired by NOA OLSR and PACMAN  
The proposed solution is to use link state messages to determine the occurance of duplicate addresses and initiate self address change in case of detection  
  
AD-hoc network applcations and technical issues, Dude from Hitachi  
3 uses for ad-hoc:  
specialized, e.g miltary, emergency, disaster  
enterprise e.g. office, home  
consumer e.g. community  
Town security System with wireless cameras, Tracking, Cellular phones using ad-hoc networking to bypass network  
ITS service systems  
3 test systems  
Security system with 8 olsr nodes, cameras and pda  
Car mobile network with auto handover between wilan and cellular, using olsr and mobile IPv6
